# Docker Swarm demo
*A simple intro to using docker swarm for container orchestration*

### What is swarm?
- Container orchestration built into docker (called swarm mode)
- Schedules containers across manager and worker nodes
- Dynamic container discovery through DNS within the swarm using docker services
- Expose services to the outside world on docker host ports
- Group sets of services into stack files for easy deployment

*See the commands file for a demo run through*
